# 508.dev Discord Bot

A Discord bot for the 508.dev co-op with multiple features.

## Overview

The 508.dev Discord bot provides convenient functionality right in Discord.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Email Integration**: Automatically forwards emails from your monitored inbox to Discord channels, keeping the team informed of important messages without constant email checking.
- **Modular Design**: New features can be added independently by different developers without conflicts.

## Current Features

### Email Monitor (`bot/features/email_monitor.py`)
- Polls IMAP email inbox for new messages
- Posts new emails to designated Discord channel
- Commands: `!st` (start), `!is_running` (status)

### Example Feature (`bot/features/example_feature.py`)
- Template showing common patterns
- Basic commands: `!hello`, `!ping`, `!info`
- Event listener example (member join)
- Use as starting point for new features

## Quick Start (Local Development)

For local development and testing. Production deployment is handled by [Coolify](https://coolify.508.dev/).

1. **Install uv (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Windows
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

   # Or via pip
   pip install uv
   ```

   See [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Environment Variables

Required:
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `EMAIL_USERNAME` - Email account username
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - Email account password

Optional (with defaults):
- `CHANNEL_ID` - Discord channel ID for notifications
- `CHECK_EMAIL_WAIT` - Email check interval in minutes
- `IMAP_SERVER` - IMAP server hostname
- `SMTP_SERVER` - SMTP server hostname

## Adding New Features

The bot automatically loads all feature files from `bot/features/`. To add new functionality:

1. Copy the example: `cp bot/features/example_feature.py bot/features/my_feature.py`
2. Modify the class name and add your commands
3. Restart the bot - your feature loads automatically

Each feature is implemented as a Discord.py "Cog" (framework term) that can include:
- **Commands** (`@commands.command()`)
- **Event listeners** (`@commands.Cog.listener()`)  # Framework decorator
- **Background tasks** (`@tasks.loop()`)
- **Configuration** (access via `settings`)

## Architecture Benefits

- **Independent Development**: Multiple developers can work on separate features
- **Auto-loading**: New features are discovered and loaded automatically
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic settings with validation and type hints
- **Clean Separation**: Configuration, core bot logic, and features are separate
- **Easy Testing**: Individual features can be developed and tested independently
